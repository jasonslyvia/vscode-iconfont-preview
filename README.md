## Requirements

Currently this extension should be used in conjunction with [iconfont.cn](iconfont.cn), but it should be easy to applied to other kind of iconfont services with svg fallback support.

## Known Limitations

If you define multiple iconfont(ie. using `@font-family` directive) in one file, only the first one will be parsed.
